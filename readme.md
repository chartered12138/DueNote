This app I am building looks like the IOS innate app Notes, but this app is used to work like reminder, for users to put tasks in a table as a to-do list. The cells in the table view is able to present the title, a due date, and a count down of remaining time for each tasks. I would like to allow users to enter items as tasks with a time constraint with regular notes content area. This idea is generated to address an issue surrounding me all the time: when I want to add a task or assignment to calendar or reminder, I cannot enter large amount of text that might be the instructions or the work that I am about to do and the notes app cannot remind me of the deadline.
